NEURO-GALAXY: ECD EVOLUTION SYSTEM 🌌
​Version: V39 | Architecture: Galaxy-Planet Core
​🔱 Technical Logic Overview
​This repository contains the core PyTorch-based architecture for the Neuro-Galaxy Evolution System. The system simulates a cosmic environment designed to map growth and resource management through object-oriented neural modules.
​🚀 Code Components & Functions
​1. Class: Galaxy(nn.Module)
​The Galaxy class acts as the central hub and computational container for all cosmic entities.
​Initialization: Sets the global environment parameters like size (100) and density (0.5).
​Storage: Manages lists of planets, stars, and black_holes.
​Dynamic Expansion: * add_planet(): Dynamically integrates new developmental nodes (Planets) into the system.
​add_star(): Adds energy sources (Stars) to the galaxy.
​add_black_hole(): Introduces high-mass risk factors (Black Holes).
​2. Class: Planet(nn.Module)
​The Planet class represents an individual entity within the galaxy, tracking its biological and resource status.
​Attributes:
​mass: Set to 10, representing the structural weight of the node.
​resources: Starts at 100, representing the available energy for growth.
​population: Tracks the density of the entity.
​Core Function:
​create_life(): A boolean trigger that shifts the state of life from False to True when developmental conditions are met.
​🛠 Prerequisites
​To execute this model, you need:
​Python 3.x
​PyTorch (torch)
​NumPy (numpy)
